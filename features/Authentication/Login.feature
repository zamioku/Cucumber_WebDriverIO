        Given the browser is at the "Login" page

    Scenario Outline: Attempting to login with valid credentials; "<username>"
        When the user tries to enter "valid" credentials, "<username>" to login
        Then the user should be signed in
        And the title of the page should be "Store | Learner US Site"

        @dev
        Examples:
