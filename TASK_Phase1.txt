Question 1: Are you going to ask any additional, more precise questions during the refinement / requirement
            definition stage?

Answer: Yes, I would ask if the login feature should handle empty fields for username / password, and if 
        there are any specific errors displayed for each field when it is empty or has an incorrect pattern.

Question 2: If you have received the answers to all your questions from the Product Owner / Manager /
            Client, create test cases to the above-mentioned user story using Gherkin.

Answer: Please read ./features/Authentication/Login.feature
